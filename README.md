[01:50.37] 
[01:42.45] Every time I'm walkin' out
[01:44.30] I can hear you tellin' me to turn around
[01:47.20] Fightin' for my trust and you won't back down
[01:49.73] Even if we gotta risk it all right now, oh

[01:55.26] You don't wanna be alone (alone)
[01:57.99] I know I always come and go (and go)
[02:00.47] But it's out of my control
[02:13.47] 
[02:03.59] And you'll be left in the dust
[02:06.75] Unless I stuck by ya
[02:09.41] You're the sunflower
[02:12.11] I think your love would be too much
[02:14.49] Or you'll be left in the dust
[02:17.32] Unless I stuck by ya
[02:19.42] You're the sunflower
